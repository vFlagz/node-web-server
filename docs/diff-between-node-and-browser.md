In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the document, window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.

And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.


# CommonJS

CommonJS is a set of standards used to implement modules on JavaScript. The project was started by Mozilla engineer Kevin Dangoor in 2009. CommonJS is mainly used in server-side JS apps with Node, as browsers don't support the use of CommonJS.
