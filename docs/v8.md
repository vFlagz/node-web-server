JavaScript is generally considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines no longer just interpret JavaScript, they compile it.

This has been happening since 2009, when the SpiderMonkey JavaScript compiler was added to Firefox 3.5, and everyone followed this idea.

JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.

# ES6

All ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features are split into three groups for shipping, staged, and in progress features:

All shipping features, which V8 considers stable, are turned on by default on Node.js and do NOT require any kind of runtime flag.
Staged features, which are almost-completed features that are not considered stable by the V8 team, require a runtime flag: --harmony.
In progress features can be activated individually by their respective harmony flag, although this is highly discouraged unless for testing purposes. Note: these flags are exposed by V8 and will potentially change without any deprecation notice.
